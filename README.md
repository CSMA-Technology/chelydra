# Chelydra aka Desk Defender

## About the Project
### Overview
**Desk Defender** is a tower defense game where the player uses common desk litter as towers to prevent work soldiers from shoving emails, messages, etc into the playerâ€™s phone. The player can collect towers as cards to deploy in the level.

### Narrative
You're at work on a virtual meeting, and you're starting to doze off. You are transported into a dream-state in which your desk items have come alive and are your only defense against the notifications piling up from your evil Boss sending you more and more work. 

The only way to survive is to use staplers, desk fans, erasers, and anything else you can find to build defenses against the notification soldiers that are trying to get to your phone on the other side of your desk. Keep the soldiers away for as long as you can, otherwise they'll push too many alerts into your phone and you'll have to wake up and go back to work!
